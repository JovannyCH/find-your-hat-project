# **Find your hat**
My project is not the better but, I implement only two forms to play:
1. Try the game.
2. Create your board and play.
3. Quit the game.


We can add the hard mode but I thought that if you create your board
you can decide how many holes has the board? you have decision to play with the mode 
that you want and the try game only have a one board but I think to add more and when 
you take the first option play with differents boards that I defined.
